        <h1>About Arch Linux</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At Arch Linux, we believe in the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. We provide users with a minimal
                base
                system that can be customized and expanded to fit their needs. We believe that users should have the freedom
                to
                choose what software and packages they want to install, and that the distribution should not get in the way
                of
                their productivity.</p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Arch Linux was founded in 2002 by Judd Vinet, who wanted to create a Linux distribution that was simple,
                lightweight, and fast. The first version of Arch Linux was released in 2002, and since then, the
                distribution has
                grown in popularity among developers, power users, and enthusiasts.</p>
